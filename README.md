## CSV Output Format

The generated CSV files contain the following columns (compatible with Readwise):

- **Highlight**: The actual text of the highlight (mandatory)
- **Title**: The name of the book (extracted from HTML header)
- **Author**: The author of the book (extracted from HTML header)
- **URL**: (empty for books, used for articles)
- **Note**: Your personal notes attached to the highlight
- **Location**: Sequential number indicating highlight order
- **Date**: When the highlight was made (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)

### üìù About Book Titles & Authors

The tool automatically extracts book titles and authors from the HTML file's header (the `<h2>` tag), which typically follows the format: **"Book Title - Author Name"**.

**If the book title or author appears incorrect in your CSV:**
1. Open the generated CSV file in Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor
2. Manually edit the **Title** and **Author** columns as needed
3. Save the file and proceed with Readwise import

*Common reasons for incorrect extraction: unusual formatting in the original Meebook export, titles with dashes, or missing author information.*
