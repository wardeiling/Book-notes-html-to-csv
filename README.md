## üîç Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

**"No HTML files found in html-files folder"**
- Make sure you placed your Meebook HTML exports in the `html-files/` folder
- Check that files have `.html` extension

**"No highlights found"**
- Verify the HTML files are from a Meebook/Haoqing Reading export
- Some books might not have highlights if none were made during reading

**"Python not found" (Windows)**
- The batch file should handle this automatically
- If issues persist, install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and try again

**"Permission denied" or file errors**
- Make sure the `output/` folder isn't open in another program
- Check that you have write permissions in the directory

### Getting HTML Files from Your Meebook
1. **Connect via USB**: Transfer files directly from your device
2. **Email Method**: Email the HTML files to yourself from the ereader
3. **Cloud Sync**: If your Meebook syncs to cloud storage, download from there
4. **Reading App**: Export from the companion reading app on your phone/tablet

### Import Tips for Readwise
- Use the **combined CSV file** (`all_books_combined.csv`) for all books at once
- Or import **individual CSV files** if you prefer to process books separately
- Readwise will automatically deduplicate if you accidentally import the same highlights twice
